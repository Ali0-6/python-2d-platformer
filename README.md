# 🎮 Python 2D Platformer Game

A fully functional 2D platformer game built in Python using Pygame. This project demonstrates structured software engineering practice, from initial design to iterative testing and refinement.

## 🧑‍💻 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pygame**

## 🪄 Features
- Player movement with physics-based mechanics
- Collision detection with platforms and obstacles
- Sprite management and animations
- Event-driven input handling
- Structured game states (menu, gameplay, game over)
- Alpha, beta, white-box, and black-box testing incorporated

## ⚒️ Development Process
1. **Learning & Planning**  
   Independently learned Python and Pygame from scratch. Defined target audience and planned game mechanics using the Waterfall development methodology.

2. ⌨️ **Design & Documentation**  
   Produced a 140-page documentation covering:
   - Design specifications  
   - Iterative debugging notes  
   - Testing procedures  
   - Problem-solving strategies

3. 🖱️ **Implementation**  
   Built game mechanics step-by-step, integrating physics, collision detection, and sprite management. Followed structured state control to ensure clean and maintainable code.

4. 🖥️ **Testing & Feedback**  
   Conducted comprehensive testing with three external users:
   - White-box testing  
   - Black-box testing  
   - Alpha & beta testing  
   Feedback was analyzed to refine gameplay, resolve edge cases, and improve usability.

## 📗 Lessons Learned
- How to independently learn and implement a project from scratch
- Structuring code with clean state management
- Effective debugging and problem documentation
- User testing and iterative improvement

## 🔮 Potential Improvements
- Adding more levels and increasing complexity  
- Implementing sound effects and background music  
- Improving AI behavior for enemies  
- Optimizing performance for larger maps
